# José Armando Ordoñez · AI Engineer | MLOps Specialist | Data Architect

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm an Artificial Intelligence Engineer focused on solving complex problems through applied machine learning, scalable pipelines, and intelligent system design. I specialize in building end-to-end solutions that bridge research, data engineering, and real-world AI deployment.


##  Recent Projects

### 1. Multimodal Reasoning System (RAG + CLIP + LLM)
A QA system over images and documents using vision-language models and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).
- CLIP for visual embedding
- FAISS for semantic search
- LLM (e.g., GPT or Claude) for context-based generation
- LangChain orchestration

### ⚙️ ## 🤖 Featured Project: AI-Powered Job Application Agent


This system builds an autonomous agent that scrapes real job listings from the web, retrieves key job data, calls a language model to generate customized resumes and cover letters, validates the output using guardrails and custom evaluations, and includes a human-in-the-loop step for quality assurance.

### Key Capabilities:
- 🔍 Web scraping with Puppeteer
- 🧠 Prompt-based generation using LLMs (OpenAI, Claude, etc.)
- ✅ Custom evaluation of keyword relevance and tone
- 🛡️ Guardrails to detect hallucinations or unsafe output
- 👨‍💻 Human review with editable markdown UI
- 🧪 Test-first development (Jest, E2E)
- 💻 Built in TypeScript with modern architecture (monorepo + Next.js)

➡️ [View the project on GitHub](https://github.com/armandoordonez/job-application-agent)

### 3. Real-Time Anomaly Detection & Forecasting
Time series pipeline for real-time business KPI forecasting and anomaly alerts.
- Forecasting with Prophet and DeepAR
- Anomaly detection with Autoencoders
- Kafka + Spark Streaming for real-time processing
- Interactive dashboards (Streamlit or Dash)

 _Coming soon_

###  4. Natural Language to SQL Compiler with Transformers
A model that translates natural language questions into SQL queries, fine-tuned on the Spider dataset.
- Transformer model (T5) fine-tuned with HuggingFace
- SQLite test backend
- Streamlit interface for live query testing

 _Coming soon_
