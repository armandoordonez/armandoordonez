# Jos√© Armando Ordo√±ez ¬∑ AI Engineer | MLOps Specialist | Data Architect

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm an Artificial Intelligence Engineer focused on solving complex problems through applied machine learning, scalable pipelines, and intelligent system design. I specialize in building end-to-end solutions that bridge research, data engineering, and real-world AI deployment.


##  Recent Projects

### 1. Multimodal Reasoning System (RAG + CLIP + LLM)
A QA system over images and documents using vision-language models and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).
- CLIP for visual embedding
- FAISS for semantic search
- LLM (e.g., GPT or Claude) for context-based generation
- LangChain orchestration
